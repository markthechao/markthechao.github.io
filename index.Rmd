## Introduction

Have you ever wondered when your 10000-day birthday is? 

This app computes your N-th day birthday (N days after your birtyday). It returns your 10000, 20000 and 30000-day birthdays by default. You can also input any N you want and click "Ask me!" to compute it.

First, input the following information:
- Your birthday
- Number of days from your birthday

Then click the "Ask me!" button to calculate results.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is to add number of days to the birthday. For example:
```{r}
bday <- strptime("1984-12-12",format = "%Y-%m-%d")
days <- 10000
nbday <- as.Date(bday + days*3600*24)
main <- paste0("Your ",days,"-day birthday is ",nbday,"!")
print(main)
```

## Acknowledgement

The heart plot appeared after clicking the "Ask me!" button was borrowed from http://felixfan.github.io/FunPlots/.

Pretty cool, huh?

```
t = seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
x = 16 * sin(t)^3; 
y = 13 * cos(t) - 5 * cos(2 * t) - 2 * cos(3 * t) - cos(4 * t)
plot(x, y, type = "l", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", 
     ylab = "", frame.plot = FALSE, asp=0.8)
polygon(x, y, col = "red", border = "red")
xp = c(-14, -13, -10, -5, 5, 7, 11, 14, -16, 15)
yp = c(-10, -5, -8, -13, -15, -13, -9, -7, 11, 12)
points(xp, yp, pch = 169, font = 5, col = "red", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
```
